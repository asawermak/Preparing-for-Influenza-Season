# Influenza Season Staffing Analysis for Medical Staffing Agency
## Goal
#### To assist a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for the influenza season, a period when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

## Business Requirements
#### As an analyst, I need technical skills to analyze data and soft skills to communicate insights to stakeholders. I’ll start by distilling business requirements and requests into questions I can answer with an analysis. I’ll follow up by sourcing and curating the data to address these questions. After analyzing the data and drawing conclusions or formulating recommendations from my results, I’ll present my insights to stakeholders in an easily consumable format.
#### These requirements should guide my approach to the analysis. While this project uses data from healthcare, the steps and framework involved can be applied to projects in any domain.

## Project Overview
#### Motivation: The United States experiences an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some individuals, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and require hospitalization. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.
#### Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
#### Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Stakeholder Identification
#### Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors)

#### Hospitals and clinics using the staffing agency’s services

#### Influenza patients

#### Staffing agency administrators

## Success Factors
#### The project’s success will be based on: A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources.
#### Minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states. A state is considered understaffed if the staff-to-patient ratio is lower than 90% of the required ratio and overstaffed if greater than 110%.

## ssumptions & Constraints
### Assumptions:

#### Vulnerable populations suffer the most severe impacts from the flu and are the most likely to end up in the hospital.
#### Flu shots decrease the chance of becoming infected with the flu.

### Constraints:
#### The staffing agency has a limited number of nurses, physician assistants, and doctors on staff.
#### There’s no budget to hire additional medical personnel.

## Requirements
#### 1. Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.

#### 2. Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, identify whether it starts and ends at the same time in every state.

#### 3. Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.

#### 4. Assess data limitations that may prevent desired analyses.

## Glossary
#### Influenza: A contagious viral infection, often causing fever and aches.
#### Vulnerable populations: Patients likely to develop flu complications requiring additional care, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include adults over 65 years, children under 5 years, pregnant women, and individuals with HIV/AIDS, cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, and children with neurological disorders.

## Additional Context
#### A count of historical influenza deaths provides an indication of the severity of the flu in an area. Deaths can be prevented with flu shots and adequate medical staff. In the United States, each state has a different population composition, meaning some states will have more vulnerable populations. In this project, particular attention should be paid to influenza deaths, vulnerable populations, and (optionally) flu-shot rates—especially in vulnerable populations—to determine medical staffing needs.


## Data Sets
#### The following data sets covering influenza in the United States will be used during the project:

#### 1. Influenza deaths by geography
#### Source: CDC
#### Download Data Set

#### 2. Population data by geography, time, age, and gender
#### Source: US Census Bureau
#### Download Data Set
### Note: These numbers are estimates; hence the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total in the first columns, but that’s totally okay.

#### 3. Counts of influenza laboratory test results by state (survey)
#### Source: CDC (Fluview)
#### Download Influenza Visits Data Set
#### Download Lab Tests Data Set

#### 4. Survey of flu shot rates in children

## Analysis Criteria
#### -> Explain the data cleaning conducted.

#### -> Select and integrate at least two relevant data sets from different sources.

#### -> Identify or create a hypothesis to test with the data.

#### -> Examine the relationship between variables, identifying at least one correlation.

#### -> Include spatial and temporal visualizations in the final deliverable.

#### -> Present conclusions, recommendations, and proposed next steps.

#### -> Consider the audience when determining which analysis components to include in the final presentation.
